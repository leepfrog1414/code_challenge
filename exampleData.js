  // my attempt ***************
  
  first look at how many lines does the card have and figure out what type of card are you dealing with... 
  
  if it has 5 lines it is a small business card and name is the second line
  if it has 8 lines it is a medium business card and name is the third line
  if it has 10 lines it is a large business card and name is the first line
  
  then look over the lines and see if you can see... 
  if it has @ or .com then set it to email
  else if it has "-" and not "fax" set it to phone number
  
  //pass in the exampleInputs and search for what we need to pull out 
  getName = function(exampleInputs){
    
  };
  
  getPhoneNumber = function(exampleInputs){
  
  };
  
  getEmailAddress(exampleInputs){
  
  };
